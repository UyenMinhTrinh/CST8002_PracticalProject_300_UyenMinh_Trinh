## Project Description
This project is part of the CST8002 course, focusing on iterative development, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and practical implementation of programming concepts in Python. The project involves:
- Creating a custom Record object.
- Parsing and processing data from a CSV file.
- Displaying the records and author information in the console.
- Using Git for version control with proper commit tagging.

## Features
1. **Custom Record Class**:
   - A Python class representing individual records from a dataset.

2. **File Input/Output (File-IO)**:
   - Reads data from a CSV file.
   - Handles exceptions for missing or inaccessible files.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Parses CSV data into Record objects.
   - Stores Record objects in a list for further processing.

4. **Data Display**:
   - Outputs all record data to the console.
   - Displays the author's full name prominently during execution.

5. **Version Control**:
   - Git repository with tagged commits (`v1.0` for Phase 1 completion).

## Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `csv` (Standard Library)
